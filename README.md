# INSURE

This is a challeneg I took from https://www.frontendmentor.io/.

The main idea is to form muscle memory around pixel-perfection, mobile-first and responsiveness.
I'm using React just for practice and familiarity, working with Components, passing Props for Custom Components and working with CSS Modules.

Inspired by Kevin Powell https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn-DQCifeQQ RESPOSNIVE DESIGN MADE EASY

## The approach

### Step One

* Lay out all of the HTML first, while using the web version of the design as a reference.
* In this specific case since I'm using React, that means also laying out all of the Components.

### Step Two

* Start adding styles from the broad to the narrow. Keep it simple and general at first.
* At this point we start adding the fonts, color palletes, custom properties, paddings, utility classes and so on.

### Step Three

* Optimize the mobile version, since it tends to be the less complex version of the layout, usually we get everything stacked.

### Step Four

* Start adding more complexity through Media-Queries @media(min-width)

## Available Commands

###  `npm start` `npm run build` `npm test` `npm run eject`
